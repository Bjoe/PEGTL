# Test with the PEGTL_USE_BOOST_FILESYSTEM option which forces the build to use
# the Boost.Filesystem alternative to std::filesystem. This option is there so
# that consumers who are still building with Boost.Filesystem can work with
# PEGTL, although they still need support for the rest of the C++17 standard.
